# Kidnapper_arguments
The application displays the arguments passed to it

# How it works
Start tka.exe with the arguments and get them on the screen

# Example
Run cmd.exe, go to the folder with the executable file from the project (tka.exe) and type the following command:
> tka.exe example.argument

If there are several arguments specify them separated by a space
